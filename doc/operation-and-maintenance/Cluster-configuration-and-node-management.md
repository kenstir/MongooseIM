## Environment configuration

### File descriptors

To handle large traffic, some of the system variables need to be tuned. 
Number one on that list is the maximum number of file descriptors which by default is set to 1024. 
Each MongooseIM connection consumes ~1 file descriptor, so the default value will not suffice for larger installations - when it is exceeded, emfile errors will appear in logs.

To check the current limit execute: `ulimit -n`.

To list all limits execute: `ulimit -a`.

In the example below we set limits for a `mongooseim` user. 
To increase the limit the following entries should be added in `/etc/security/limits.conf`:

```
mongooseim   soft   nofile   1000000

mongooseim   hard   nofile   1000000
```

If you are using **Ubuntu**, all `/etc/pam.d/common-session*` files should include `session required pam_limits.so`.

### `vm.args` and `vars.config` files

Before making a release, some values in `rel/files/vm.args` have to be changed. 
When using an SSL/TLS connection we advise to increase `ERL_MAX_PORTS` to `350000`. 
This value specifies how many ports (files, drivers, sockets etc) can be used by Erlang VM.
Be cautious - it preallocates some structures inside the VM and will have impact on memory usage. 
We suggest 350000 for 100Â k users when using an SSL/TLS connection or 250000 in other cases.

**Note**: Make sure running `mongooseim` has `-args_file` parameter set to this file `rel/files/vm.args`. 
By default it is pointing to 'etc/vm.args'. 
You can view this by running 'mongooseim live' command.
 
To check how memory consumption changes depending on `ERL_MAX_PORTS`, use the following command:

`env ERL_MAX_PORTS=[given value] erl -noinput -eval 'io:format("~p~n",[erlang:memory(system)]).' -s erlang halt`

Another change you need to make when building a MongooseIM cluster is setting the `-sname`. 
To do it, just set `node_name` in `rel/vars.config` with node's hostname, which **must** be resolvable on other nodes in the cluster.

### Port range

To connect to other nodes, a freshly started node uses a port from the range `inet_dist_listen_min` to `inet_dist_listen_max`.

To enable this, add the following line to the `vm.args` file:

`-kernel inet_dist_listen_min 50000 inet_dist_listen_max 50010`

Make sure that the range you set provides enough ports for all the nodes in the cluster.

Remember to keep an epmd port open (port 4369) if any firewall restrictions are required.
Epmd keeps track of which erlang node is using which ports on the local machine.

## Load Balancing

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)

When using ELB pleas be advised that many of our users reported it to prematurely drop connections, especially when using BOSH.

### DNS-based load balancing

Load balancing can be performed on a DNS level. 
A DNS response can have a number of IP addresses that can be returned to the client side in a random order. 

On the AWS stack this type of balancing is provided by Route53. 
The description of their service can be found at:

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/WeightedResourceRecordSets.html

### Software load balancer

A good example of load balancing on the application layer are HAProxy and Nginx. 

### Other

The approaches described above can be mixed - we can use DNS load balancing to pick a software load balancer which will select one of the nodes.

## Connecting nodes

Checklist:

- working directory `rel/mongooseim`
- the same cookie across all nodes (`vm.args` `-setcookie` parameter)
- each node should be able to ping other nodes using its sname
   (ex. `net_adm:ping('mongoose@localhost')`)
- no mnesia files - no `Mnesia.mongooseim@[host name]` directory in cwd on new node's release

### Initial node

There is no action required on the initial node.

Just start MongooseIM using `mongooseim start` or `mongooseim live`.

### New node

#### MongooseIM 1.7.0 and newer

Cluster management commands changed a bit since MongooseIM 1.7.0. 
Now we call them from a running node that is going to leave or join the cluster.

```bash
mongooseimctl join_cluster ClusterMember
```

`ClusterMember` is the name of a running node set in `vm.args` file, for example `mongooseim@localhost`. 
This nodehas to be part of the cluster we'd like to join.

The successful output from the above command starts with `You have successfully joined the node to the cluster`.

#### MongooseIM before 1.7.0

For an older `MongooseIM` please see the previous versions of the documentation.

### Remove node

#### MongooseIM 1.7.0 and newer

Since MongooseIM 1.7.0 there are two commands for removing a node from the cluster.
To leave a running node from the cluster, call:

```bash
mongooseimctl leave_cluster
```

It only makes sense to use it if the node is the part of a cluster, e.g `join_cluster` was called from that node before.

The successful output from the above command starts with `You have successfully left the node from the cluster`.

To remove another node from the cluster, call the following command from one of the cluster members:

```bash
mongooseimctl remove_from_cluster RemoteNodeName
```

where `RemoteNodeName` is a name of the node that we'd like to remove from our cluster. 
This command could be useful when the node is dead and not responding and we'd like to remove it remotely.
The successful output from above command starts with `The node has been removed from the cluster`

#### MongooseIM before 1.7.0

For an older `MongooseIM` please see the previous versions of the documentation.

### Cluster status

To see if a newly added node is properly clustered or to see how the cluster looks like, the following commands can be useful (on any running node in the cluster).

```bash
mongooseimctl mnesia info | grep "running db nodes"
```

This command shows all running nodes. 
A healthy cluster should contain all nodes here. 
For example:

    running db nodes   = [mongooseim@node1, mongooseim@node2]

To see stopped or misbehaving nodes following command can be useful:

```bash
mongooseimctl mnesia info | grep "stopped db nodes"
```

This command shows which nodes are considered stopped. 
This does not necessarily indicate that they are down but might be a symptom of a communication problem.
